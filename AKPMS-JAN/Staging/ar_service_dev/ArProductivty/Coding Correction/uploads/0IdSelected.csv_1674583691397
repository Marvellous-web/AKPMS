Hi Lashea,
 
Can you please review this account with Dr Kapoor?  The pt is 76 years old and he only has Medicare part A.  Pt states he has no money and is asking for a discount.  Please let me know as the pt has already called 4x.

Received call from pt the second time regarding balance $4,960.00 for dos 3/19/17 - 5/3/17. Balance is due as MCR denied as Insurance cannot be identified patient. Pt called & stated that earlier he has called requested for discount as he is 76 years old & has heart attack, do not have good income. Pt said he wants to pay the bill but wants some discount on it as bill is so high.
